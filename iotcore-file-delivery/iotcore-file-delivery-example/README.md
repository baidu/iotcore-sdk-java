# File Delivery SDK Example

There are 2 types examples in this module, i.e. standalone and concurrent.
Standalone example means the `Peer` instance is only responsible for one uploading or downloading task at the same time.
On the other hand, concurrent example the `Peer` instance has more than one task at the same time.

All the files for example are in resource/file directory, users can copy to the target file directories, e.g. uploader and responder for different file delivery scenarios.
